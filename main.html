	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is The time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. Note that the time to run is a function of the length of the input and not the actual execution time of the machine on which the algorithm is running on efficient.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> Big-O notation describes an asymptotic upper bound. It represents the algorithmâ€™s scalability and performance O(n).</p>
